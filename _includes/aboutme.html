                <p> I'm an electronic engineer and a developer. I'm interested in all forms of information and communications technology, but my major focus is on development, mainly Python. I also have skills in other areas like web development and languages, like Java and C. I'm inquisitive, self taught, love to share what I learn, and unafraid of challenges.
